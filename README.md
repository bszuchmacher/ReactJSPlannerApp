-Thank you for taking time to check out my ToDo React Planner App. This was a labour of love.

-Everyone now is so careful to set reminders on their phones to do everything...appointments, etc.

-My intention with this app started as a coding project from school. I noticed that when I go shopping I usually forget what I need to get... even if I have a list in hand...but I usually have my phone open with the browser open. So as a push to remember EXACTLY what I wanted to get or do...I made this App in React, so that I can change on the fly exactly what I wanted to buy or get done daily.

-Try out the code and let me know what you think!
